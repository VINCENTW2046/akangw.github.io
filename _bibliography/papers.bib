			abstract = {{We study the Nesting Problem, which aims to determine a configuration of a set of irregular shapes within a rectangular sheet of material of fixed width, such that no overlap among the shapes exists, and such that the length of the sheet is minimized. When both translation and rotation of the shapes are allowed, the problem can be formulated as a nonconvex quadratically constrained programming model that approximates each shape by a set of inscribed circles and enforces that circle pairs stemming from different shapes do not overlap. However, despite many recent advances in today's global optimization solvers, solving this nonconvex model to guaranteed optimality remains extremely challenging even for the state-of-the-art codes. In this paper, we propose a customized branch-and-bound approach to address the Nesting Problem to guaranteed optimality. Our approach utilizes a novel branching scheme to deal with the reverse convex quadratic constraints in the quadratic model and incorporates a number of problem-specific algorithmic tweaks. Our computational studies on a suite of 64 benchmark instances demonstrate the customized algorithm's effectiveness and competitiveness over the use of general-purpose global optimization solvers, including for the first time the ability to find global optimal nestings featuring five polygons under free rotation.}}

	abstract = {We study the strategic decision-making problem of assigning time windows to customers in the context of vehicle routing applications that are affected by operational uncertainty. This problem, known as the Time Window Assignment Vehicle Routing Problem, can be viewed as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem, where time window assignments constitute first-stage decisions, vehicle routes adhering to the assigned time windows constitute second-stage decisions, and the objective is to minimize the expected routing costs. We prove that a sampled deterministic equivalent of this stochastic model can be reduced to a variant of the Consistent Vehicle Routing Problem, and we leverage this result to develop a new scenario decomposition algorithm to solve it. From a modeling viewpoint, our approach can accommodate both continuous and discrete sets of feasible time window assignments as well as general scenario-based models of uncertainty for several routing-specific parameters, including customer demands and travel times, among others. From an algorithmic viewpoint, our approach can be easily parallelized, can utilize any available vehicle routing solver as a black box, and can be readily modified as a heuristic for large-scale instances. We perform a comprehensive computational study to demonstrate that our algorithm strongly outperforms all existing solution methods, as well as to quantify the trade-off between computational tractability and expected cost savings when considering a larger number of future scenarios during strategic time window assignment.}
