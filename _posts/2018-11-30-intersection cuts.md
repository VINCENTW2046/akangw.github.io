description: an introduction to intersection cuts
---

The idea of Intersection Cuts was originally proposed by Prof. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egon_Balas" target="_blank">Egon Balas</a>  to generate valid cuts for integer programming. It has gradually received more and more attention in other areas such as reverse convex programming, polynomial programming, among others.
