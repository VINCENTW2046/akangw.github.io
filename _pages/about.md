Hello, I'm Akang Wang, a research assistant in <a href="https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/research/process-systems.html" target="_blank">the Department of Chemical Engineering (Process Systems Engineering) at Carnegie Mellon University</a>.
I obtained my Ph.D. degree at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in 2020, working with <a href="https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/gounaris-chrysanthos.html" target="_blank">Prof. Chrysanthos E. Gounaris</a>. 
My Ph.D. research was mainly focused on developing mathematical models and algorithms for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain" target="_blank">Supply Chain Logistics</a>; 
besides that, I also did some work in the area of <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GlobalOptimization.html" target="_blank">Global Optimization. 

In this website, you can know more about my research and experience. 
Feel free to check them out.
