Hello, I'm Akang Wang, a second year Ph.D. student in Chemical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, working with [Chrysanthos E. Gounaris](https://www.cmu.edu/cheme/people/faculty/chrysanthos-e-gounaris.html). 

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your automatically.
