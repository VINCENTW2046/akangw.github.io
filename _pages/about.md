Hello, I'm Akang Wang, an Algorithm Engineer at <a href="https://www.didiglobal.com/" target="_blank">DiDi Chuxing</a>.
I obtained my Ph.D. degree at <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a> in 2020, working with <a href="https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/directory/bios/gounaris-chrysanthos.html" target="_blank">Prof. Chrysanthos E. Gounaris</a> in the area of <a href="https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/research/process-systems.html" target="_blank">Process Systems Engineering</a>. 
My Ph.D. research was mainly focused on developing mathematical models and algorithms for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supply_chain" target="_blank">Supply Chain & Logistics</a>; 
besides that, I also did some work in <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GlobalOptimization.html" target="_blank">Global Optimization</a>. 
Prior to Carnegie Mellon, I received my B.S. in Chemical Engineering at <a href="http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/index.htm" target="_blank">Tianjin University</a> and had a minor in Finance at <a href="https://en.nankai.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Nankai University</a>.
