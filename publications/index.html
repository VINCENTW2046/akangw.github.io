    <p>This paper proposes a scenario-sampling framework to estimate the expected incremental routing cost required so as to incorporate a target customer into the stochastic supply chain network. The cost estimate is shown to converge to its true value with statistical guarantee as the number of samples increases, while the Hoeffding’s inequality can be utilized to determine a sufficient sample size for a desired estimation accuracy. Inspired from a real-life setting arising in distribution of industrial gases, we sample instances of multi-depot vehicle routing problems with inter-depot routes, and we use these as scenarios towards a demonstration of the marginal cost estimation framework and towards a detailed study to elucidate the quality of our estimates.
	In order to solve such rich routing problems exactly, we also develop a tailored branch-price-andcut algorithm, which is shown to be able to solve to optimality instances of up to 70 customers within reasonable time, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art exact method.</p>

    <p>When a particular service is performed many times, the duration of the service might reduce due to the effect of learning from similar tasks that have been performed before. In this article, we present an approach to account for such learning effects that arise in the context of vehicle routing operations. Our approach enables the consideration of endogenous learning, where the service times are dependent on the experience that is to be gained in the same routing horizon. We apply our approach to the problem of planning an offshore plug and abandonment campaign, where different vessels are being used to perform plugging operations on offshore oil and gas wells. We extend existing instances for this problem with observed learning data and investigate the effects of learning and cooperation. Results show that the inclusion of an endogenous learning effect leads to different and significantly better solutions compared to those that are found when the learning effect is neglected.</p>

    <p>We study the circle-circle non-overlapping constraints, a form of reverse convex constraints that often arise in optimization models for cutting and packing applications. The feasible region induced by the intersection of circle-circle non-overlapping constraints is highly nonconvex, and standard approaches to construct convex relaxations for spatial branch-and-bound global optimization of such models typically yield unsatisfactory loose relaxations. Consequently, solving such non-convex models to guaranteed optimality remains extremely challenging even for the state-of-the-art codes. In this paper, we apply a purpose-built branching scheme on nonoverlapping constraints and utilize strengthened intersection cuts and various feasibility-based tightening techniques to further tighten the model relaxation. We embed these techniques into a branch-and-bound code and test them on two variants of circle packing problems. Our 	computational studies on a suite of 75 benchmark instances yielded, for the first time in the open literature, a total of 54 provably optimal solutions, and it was demonstrated to be competitive over the use of the state-of-the-art general-purpose global optimization solvers.</p>

    <p>We study the strategic decision-making problem of assigning time windows to customers in the context of vehicle routing applications that are affected by operational uncertainty. This problem, known as the Time Window Assignment Vehicle Routing Problem, can be viewed as a two-stage stochastic optimization problem, where time window assignments constitute first-stage decisions, vehicle routes adhering to the assigned time windows constitute second-stage decisions, and the objective is to minimize the expected routing costs. To that end, we develop in this paper a new scenario decomposition algorithm to solve the sampled deterministic equivalent of this stochastic model. From a modeling viewpoint, our approach can accommodate both continuous and discrete sets of feasible time window assignments as well as general scenario-based models of uncertainty for several routing-specific parameters, including customer demands and travel times, among others. From an algorithmic viewpoint, our approach can be easily parallelized, can utilize any available vehicle routing solver as a black box, and can be readily modified as a heuristic for large-scale instances. We perform a comprehensive computational study to demonstrate that our algorithm strongly outperforms all existing solution methods, as well as to quantify the trade-off between computational tractability and expected cost savings when considering a larger number of future scenarios during strategic time window assignment.</p>

    <p>We study the Nesting Problem, which aims to determine a configuration of a set of irregular shapes within a rectangular sheet of material of fixed width, such that no overlap among the shapes exists, and such that the length of the sheet is minimized. When both translation and rotation of the shapes are allowed, the problem can be formulated as a nonconvex quadratically constrained programming model that approximates each shape by a set of inscribed circles and enforces that circle pairs stemming from different shapes do not overlap. However, despite many recent advances in today’s global optimization solvers, solving this nonconvex model to guaranteed optimality remains extremely challenging even for the state-of-the-art codes. In this paper, we propose a customized branch-and-bound approach to address the Nesting Problem to guaranteed optimality. Our approach utilizes a novel branching scheme to deal with the reverse convex quadratic constraints in the quadratic model and incorporates a number of problem-specific algorithmic tweaks. Our computational studies on a suite of 64 benchmark instances demonstrate the customized algorithm’s effectiveness and competitiveness over the use of general-purpose global optimization solvers, including for the first time the ability to find global optimal nestings featuring five polygons under free rotation.</p>
